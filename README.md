# Robot-Project
## Finding shortest paths in a real life simulation
The project description is inside Robot-Project.ipynb.
One technical note - in order to run the project you need 'modified_input' and 'modified_input_light_orange'.
The collab notebook downloads them from github, but you can also download them manually and use them as input if you want to download the code to your computer
